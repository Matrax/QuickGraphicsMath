# QuickGraphicsMath

## Description

QuickGraphicsMath is a C++17 header-only library that provide some functions and classes to manipulate vectors, matrices or other
useful tools in graphics software.

It's not the fastest library for math, but easy to use and install in your project.

## Features

- Matrix (in row-major order and with somes utility functions for 4x4 matrices useful in graphics software, like translation, rotation, projection matrix, all the operations with vectors...)
- Vector (cross product, dot product, magnitude, distance...)
- Math functions (cos, sin, tan, clamp, min, max ...)
- Useful functions like circle and sphere equations, linear interpolation
